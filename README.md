| OCI: Workshop | [OCI: Workshop](https://blakeramos.github.io/OCI-Workshop/) | This article discusses the steps taken to deploy a webserver on an Oracle compute instance. Once the webserver has been deployed we will try to access it via a Public-IP address. Once the webserver is up and running we will setup autoscaling. Autoscaling enables you to automatically adjust the number of Compute instances in an instance pool based on performance metrics such as CPU and memory utilization. This helps you provide consistent performance for your end users during periods of high demand, and helps you reduce your costs during periods of low demand. |
